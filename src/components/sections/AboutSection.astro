          I'm Anna, a Frontend Web Developer based in Barcelona. I specialize in
          React and Next.js, but I also enjoy working with a variety of other
          tools and technologies.

          I'm passionate about learning and love exploring a wide range of
          interests â€” from cooking to web development. My goal is to build
          clean, user-friendly web applications and collaborate with great teams
          on meaningful projects. With a background in nursing, I'm especially
          drawn to creating apps that promote health and well-being.

          I spent two years teaching myself programming before enrolling in a
          React-focused Bootcamp to deepen and professionalize my skills.
