            I'm Anna, a Frontend Web Developer based in Barcelona. I specialize
            in React and Next.js, but I also enjoy working with a variety of
            other tools and technologies.

            I'm passionate about learning and love exploring a wide range of
            interests â€” from cooking to web development. My goal is to build
            clean, user-friendly web applications and collaborate with great
            teams on meaningful projects. With a background in nursing, I'm
            especially drawn to creating apps that promote health and
            well-being.

            I spent two years teaching myself programming before enrolling in a
            React-focused Bootcamp to deepen and professionalize my skills.
